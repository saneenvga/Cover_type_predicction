Forest Cover Type Prediction (ML Classification Project)

A machine learning project that predicts the type of forest cover using cartographic variables such as elevation, soil type, wilderness area, slope, distance to hydrology, etc.

This project demonstrates end-to-end ML skills including:

1. Data cleaning & preprocessing
2. Feature engineering
3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
4. Model selection & hyperparameter tuning
5. Evaluation (Accuracy, F1, Confusion matrix)
6. Saving & loading the model
7. Modular Python scripts
